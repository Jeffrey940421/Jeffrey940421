# Hi there, I am Jeffrey Zhang ðŸ‘‹
A dedicated full stack software developer with strong product mindset and well-versed in crafting exceptional web applications while maintaining a strong commitment to continuous learning and rapid skill acquisition.

## About Me
I started my career as a product manager at Renogy, where I led a dedicated team of four individuals in researching the solar energy storage market, defining product roadmaps, and meticulously detailing product features. Exposed to the development of smart IoT solar energy devices, I witnessed the power of programming and made my decision to pursue a career in software development. 

To get a more comprehensive understanding of programming, I joined App Academy, a full stack software engineering bootcamp, where I immersed myself in various technologies, including JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Express, Flask, and SQL databases. I also leveraged these technologies and some third-party packages/libraries/frameworks to build some full stack web applications, including a house rental app, a social media app, and team chat app.

I am excited to bring my technical skills and product mindset to my next role, where I can continue to push boundaries, solve complex problems, and create meaningful, impactful software solutions. Connect with me to discuss how my unique background and skills can contribute to your organization's success.
